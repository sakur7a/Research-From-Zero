name: paper-search
description: Find literature across arXiv, OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar, OpenReview and Crossref at once, merge the duplicates each source reports separately, and report which sources failed instead of reading a failure as "no such paper". Use it for literature discovery, prior-art checks and topic surveys, and whenever a claim needs a source that can be checked.

# Paper search

One query, five scholarly sources, one de-duplicated list.

```bash
python scripts/paper_search.py --query "KV cache compression for long-context LLMs" \
    --start-year 2024 --end-year 2026 --json /tmp/papers.json
```

## What it does

1. Queries every source that its credentials or public access allow, in signal order:
   **Semantic Scholar → OpenAlex → arXiv → OpenReview → Crossref**.
2. Merges duplicates **across** sources — the same paper is routinely listed by several
   of them with different metadata, and a list that shows it four times is a list the
   user cannot judge.
3. Prints a per-source hit line, so "quiet" and "broken" stay distinguishable.
4. Sinks survey/review papers to the bottom of the list, tagged `[survey]`, without
   removing them.

## Credentials

Everything comes from the environment, and nothing is hardcoded. The script loads the
first file it finds, filling only variables that are **not already set** — a real
environment variable always wins:

| Order | Location |
|---|---|
| 1 | `$RE0_ENV_FILE` (explicit override) |
| 2 | `./.env` |
| 3 | `~/.codex/skills/.env` |
| 4 | `~/.re0/.env` |

Recognised names, each sent only to the service that owns it:

| Variable | Used for | Needed? |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENALEX_API_KEY` | OpenAlex | optional |
| `OPENALEX_MAILTO` | OpenAlex polite pool; identifies the caller | recommended |
| `SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY` (alias `SEMANTICSCHOLAR_API_KEY`) | Semantic Scholar | recommended — unauthenticated requests are rate limited hard |
| `OPENREVIEW_TOKEN` | OpenReview, for anything beyond public reads | optional |

The script prints how many variables the file supplied, **never a value**. No key is
written to the result file, the cache, or any log.

OpenReview is queried publicly and needs no account. Credentialed access uses a bearer
token rather than the username/password pair in some existing setups: posting a password
from inside a retrieval path would add a credential-handling surface for no gain while
public term search already answers the query. Set `OPENREVIEW_TOKEN` if you want the
wider read scope.

## Reading the output

- **`per-source hits: … · N unique (M duplicates merged)`** — if a source shows `=0` and
  also appears under "source failures", that source was **not searched**.
- **A failure is not a negative result.** A rate limit or an outage must be reported as
  such. Never write "no such work exists" because a source was unreachable.
- **An empty list is not evidence of absence.** Widen the query, change the year window,
  or recheck one source alone before concluding anything.
- `--max-papers` is bounded at 8 per source by the tool, to keep each result small
  enough to stay citable. Raise recall with a better query, not a bigger page.

## What this deliberately does not do

- **No "model knowledge" source.** Recalling papers from a model's training data is the
  most common way a literature list acquires a plausible title that does not exist. This
  skill returns only what a service actually returned; if a canonical older paper is
  missing from every source, that gap is reported rather than filled from memory.
- **No full text.** These are bibliographic records and abstracts. Nothing here supports
  a claim about a paper's experiments, and a record is never evidence that a result
  reproduces.
- **No semantic relevance filter.** The tool does not silently drop rows it judges
  irrelevant, because a dropped row is invisible to the user. Rejecting a result is the
  reader's call, made on a visible list.

## Related entry points

- `python -m re0.mcp_server` exposes the same retrieval as MCP tools for any MCP client.
- Inside Re0's own task runs, every returned record becomes stored evidence with an ID
  that a report must cite. This skill is a retrieval endpoint and creates no evidence
  IDs, so do not cite one from here.
